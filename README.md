# coral
Coral is a prototype sexual health service finder and open data provider. It was originally conceptualized and prototyped by [Team Oceanview](#team-) while competing at the [Vancouver Open Data Day Challenge](https://www.opendatabc.ca/) 2018.

## case

### prototype Problem Statement
Finding clinics providing services for sexual health is confusing, and data about patient experience using those services is lacking.

### protoype summary
Our solution is to rebuild the experience of patients looking for the best services. Then, patients using those services share anonymised feedback about their experience back through the tool.

### user stories
[View patient cases and user stories in Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GiYSv2s4QLZwA2YBogoyRy2jZTfoPtF1XsZ5aaM_pyo/edit?usp=sharing)

## open data sets

### We used open data sets made available by:
- [Options for Sexual Health](https://www.optionsforsexualhealth.org/)
- [BC CDC](http://www.bccdc.ca/)
- [Auditor General of British Columbia](http://www.bcauditor.com/)
- GPS coordinates from Google Maps

### To make the service available, we're looking for access to the following data:
- government funding data for clinics
- types of patients going to clinics
- the annual patient volume for clinics

Some of this data may be specially requested from DataBC.

## mockups üõ†

### landing page view:
* no fuss: straightforward interface to locate services

----

### service filter view:
* while we wanted to take patients to results asap, without a preliminary filter, the results would include clinics which may not provide the patient with the services needed. We consider that to be a sub-par user experience.

----

### results card view:
* this included only pertinent info. Once the patient knows the clinic is open, is located nearby, and has the feedback they're looking for, they can dig into full details by clicking into the summary card and info views.

## next steps üöÄ
* get the missing data, as detailed earlier.
* continue building out the finder service, the feedback service, and the data visualizer.
