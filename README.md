## Prototype Problem Statement
Finding clinics providing services for sexual health is confusing, and data about patient experience using those services is lacking.

## Protoype Summary
Our angle is to rebuild the experience of patients looking for services. Patients using those services share their feedback about their experience back through the tool.

## Open Data Sets

### What Open Data Sets Did You Use?
 - Options for Sexual Health
 - BC CDC
 - B.C. Auditor general of British Columbia
 - GPS coordinates from Google Maps

### What Open Data Sets Do You Still Need?
We're looking for government funding data for clinics, types of patients going to clinics, and their annual patient volume. We talked to DataBC reps. The data is not openly available, but can be requested.

## Next Steps

* Get the missing data, as detailed earlier.

## Progress
Stay tuned ðŸš€
